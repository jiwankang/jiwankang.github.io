Hello, I'm a second year student at Uwaterloo and spent almost all of my life living in Toronto. In my free time I like to play sports such as ultimate frisbee and basketball, go on trips with my friends, and work on side projects.

I started programming in high school and just finished my internship with Tulip; for more info check out my resume in the top right.
I'm now looking for a coop position for Summer 2018. Contact me at any of the links below or my cell at (647) 624-1422. Thanks!
